\usage{
lmPBJ(
  images,
  form,
  formred = ~1,
  mask,
  id = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  W = NULL,
  Winv = NULL,
  template = NULL,
  formImages = NULL,
  robust = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{images}{Character vector of subject images to be modeled as an outcome
variable OR 4d array of imaging data OR 4d nifti object.}

\item{form}{formula or character that can be coerced to a formula or a design
matrix for the full model.}

\item{formred}{formula or character that can be coerced to a formula or a
design matrix for reduced model. If robust=TRUE then this must have one less
column than X.}

\item{mask}{File name for a binary mask file or niftiImage object.}

\item{id}{Vector to identify measurements from the same observation.}

\item{data}{R data frame containing variables in form. If form and formred
are matrices then this can be NULL.}

\item{W}{Numeric vector of weights for regression model. Can be used to deweight noisy
observations. Same as what should be passed to lm.}

\item{Winv}{Inverse weights for regression model. Inverse of W.}

\item{template}{Template image used for visualization.}

\item{formImages}{n X p matrix of images where n is the number of subjects and
each column corresponds to an imaging covariate. Currently, not supported.}

\item{robust}{Logical, compute robust standard error estimates?}

\item{transform}{character indicating type of transformation to use. "none", "t", "f", or "edgeworth" are currently accepted. Edgeworth is slow.}

\item{outdir}{If specified, output is saved as NIfTIs and statMap object is
saved as strings. This approach conserves memory, but has longer IO time.
Currently, not supported.}

\item{zeros}{Exclude voxels that have zeros? Zeros may exist due to differences in masking and
coverage or they may represent locations where the data took the value zero.}

\item{HC3}{Logical, Uses HC3 SE estimates from Long and Ervin 2000? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{mc.cores}{Argument passed to mclapply for parallel things.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the following values:
\describe{
  \item{stat}{The statistical values where mask!=0. It is a chi^2-statistic map.}
  \item{coef}{A 4d niftiImage giving the parameter estimates for covariates only in the full model.}
  \item{sqrtSigma}{The covariance object used to sample from the joint distribution of the statistical image.}
  \item{mask}{The input mask.}
  \item{template}{The background template used for visualization.}
  \item{formulas}{A list containing the full and reduced models.}
}

}
\description{
This function computes a statistical map and residuals which are the
 objects necessary to perform the parametric bootstrap joint (PBJ) inference
 procedure.
